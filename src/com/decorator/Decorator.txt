1. Create a Chai inerface with cost variable, getDescription and getCost method
2. Create a Chai implementation class 
3. Create a ChaiShop client and call both the methods

Now to create a decorator means, adding extra feature for Chai without modifying the Chai class

How can we do it?

4. Create a decorator abstract class that implements Chai interface

** The rule of thumb in decorator pattern is that both the model class and the decorator class implements the same interface

5. Create a decorator implementation that extends abstract decorator class.
   This decorator implementation should get an instance of Chai in the constructor
   
6. Override the methods in the decorator

7. In ChaiShop client pass the chai object in the decorator and  that will add new features to the chai
